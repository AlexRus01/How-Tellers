        <h5 class="titluri">1. Focus your presentation</h1>
        <p class="parag">
            Having a long, rambling presentation that is hard to follow is not going to win you any audience interest.
                You need to make sure that your presentation is clear and focused and that any asides you throw into it are there to back up the main point.
        </p>
        <h5 class="titluri">2. Less is more</h5>
        <p class="parag">
            You don't want to overwhelm your audience with information and important points. Even if they're interested in your topic they'll starting spacing out and then you've lost them. 
            <br>You need to stick to your 3 points and overall point and you need to make sure that you only use the information that you need to support and clarify those points.
        </p>

        <h5 class="titluri">3. Practice</h5>
        <p class="parag">
            This is one that for some reason, lack of time perhaps, people neglect to do and it is absolutely key to giving a good presentation.
            <br>Running through the presentation before the actual event gives you time work out any kinks or problems with your notes and with your technology and makes the presentation itself go more smoothly.

        <h5 class="titluri">1. Deal with the jitters</h1>
        <p class="parag">
            Pretty much everyone gets nervous about presenting, even when it isn't in front of a bunch of people. 
            <br> That's okay. <br>All you have to do is mask the fact that you're nervous, since you won't be able to avoid the jitters themselves.
        </p>
        <h5 class="titluri">2. Engage the audience</h5>
        <p class="parag">
            One way to make your presentation memorable and interesting is to interact with your audience. <br>
            Don't act like there's a wall between you and your audience, engage them in the material. <br>
            Talk directly to them, not at them or at the back wall, but to your audience.
        </p>
        <h5 class="titluri">3. Have a killer closing</h5>
        <p class="parag">
            The beginning and the closing of a presentation are the parts that people tend to remember, so you want to make sure that you end with a punch to the gut (figuratively speaking; don't hit your audience).
             <br>You'll need to reiterate those 3 most important points and make sure the listener knows why they should care about your topic.
